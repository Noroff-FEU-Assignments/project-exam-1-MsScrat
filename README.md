## Description 

### Task and idea

We were assigned with making a blog of our liking, which where to include certian criterias (some listed below).  

My idea was to make a blog for game reviews made by girls and for girls.   
Being a girl gamer myself, I would love such a website which was not steriotyped with cozy switch games and a pink theme.  
I wanted it to be a minimalistic website, simply with games I have played and enjoyed as a girl.

### Criterias

The website is build and designed by me, with data feched from WordPress using API.  
The website includes MediaQueries for mobile (except for the slider).

#### Other criterias included is:  
- A slider at the index page. 
- A validation for the contact form.
- A "show more" button on the blog page, which loads five more posts.
- A modal on the blog specific page which enlarges the image. 

## Result
With this being an exam, there are some things added for criteria and others that's missing out because of time.    
Overall, I am very saticfied with how this turned out. Compared to earlier projects this year, I am happy to say I have made some progress!
